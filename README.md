Daniel_PrevNext
=============

### Description
Extension that allows to navigate to the next/previous product from the product view. The products need almost 1 root category, and it only uses level 1 categories if set.

NOTES
-------------
This extension is only tested on Magento CE 1.9.2.1 and its under development. I am not responsible for any errors in your production store.

##### TODO
* Move to namespace: Danielozano.
* Move to community pool.
* Test on older Magento versions.
* Design for RWD.
